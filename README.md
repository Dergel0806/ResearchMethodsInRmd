# Research Methods In Rmd

## incompleteCounterbalancing

You want to conduct an experiment to test the effect of a new drug for treating children with attention deficit
disorder. You have decided to test six different amounts of the new drug-5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15 mg. The
parents of 40 children with attention deficit disorder have volunteered their child to participate in the study.  

You know that using this procedure might result in either carryover or order effects, so you want to
counterbalance the order of presentation of the six dosages. Construct the different counterbalanced order of
treatment conditions using the incomplete counterbalancing technique in r markdown.

## BasicDescriptiveStatistics

Basic descriptive statistics in Rmd.

## ProportionalStratifiedSampling

Use the data in file “studentsNames.csv” to create a sample of size 10 of
freshmen and sophomores using proportional stratified sampling and report them in a table. Make sure
to set the seed to 2017.  
  
1. Explain your process/code briefly.
1. How many freshmen and sophomores are in the data set?
1. How many freshmen and sophomores are in your sample?
1. Is this method EPSEM? Why or why not?

## SimpleAndDisproportionalSamplings

This [list](https://ethw.org/List_of_Presidents_of_the_Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers_(IEEE)) contains the names of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) presidents from 1963 to present.  
1. Create a sample of size 10 of IEEE presidents using *simple random sampling* technique and report
them in a table.
1. Create a sample of size 10 of IEEE presidents using *disproportional stratified sampling* technique
(10% female, 90% male) and report them in a table.

## ResearchValidity

Based on `tippingArticle.pdf` theoretical analysis about 
* design elements, 
* extraneous confounding variables, 
* internal validity, 
* external validity,
* random assignment strategies  
was conducted.
