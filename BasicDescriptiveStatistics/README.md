## Descriptive Statistics

The file Beatles.csv presents information on the 12 studio albums by The Beatles. Specifically, it gives the
lengths, in seconds, of the songs, by album: Please Please Me (PPM), With The Beatles (WTB), A Hard
Day’s Night (HDN), Beatles for Sale (BFS), Help! (HLP), Rubber Soul (RBS), Revolver (RVR), Sgt. Pepper’s
Lonely Hearts Club Band (SPL), The Beatles (TBS), Yellow Submarine (YSB), Abbey Road (ABR), and Let
It Be (LIB). The albums are ordered by release date (i.e. PPM was the first album released, WTB was the
second album released, etc.). The song-lengths are arranged for each album in increasing order.

1. Determine the median song length of each album. Construct a bar graph with album name on the
horizontal axis and median song length on the vertical axis. Interpret your graph, keeping in mind that
the albums are ordered by release date.
1. Determine the range of song lengths for each album. Construct a bar graph with album name on the
horizontal axis and range of song lengths on the vertical axis. Interpret your graph.
1.  Find the quartiles of song length for each album.
1. Determine the IQR of song lengths for each album. Construct a bar graph with album name on the
horizontal axis and IQR of song lengths on the vertical axis. Interpret your graph.
1.  Find the lower and upper limits of song length for each album. Identify which albumns have potential
outliers.
1. For each album, construct a boxplot of the song lengths, and interpret your results in terms of the
variation of the song lengths. Are the outliers the same as what you determined in part e?
